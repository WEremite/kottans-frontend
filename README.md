### 1.2 HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1

These request verbs of HTTP are:

* __GET:__ fetch an existing resource. The URL contains all the necessary information the server needs to locate and return the resource.
* __POST:__ create a new resource. POST requests usually carry a payload that specifies the data for the new resource.
* __PUT:__ update an existing resource. The payload may contain the updated data for the resource.
* __DELETE:__ delete an existing resource.

Status Codes:

* 1xx: Informational Messages
* 2xx: Successful (The most common code is 200 __OK__)
* 3xx: Redirection
* 4xx: Client Error (Yep, 404 the most common code)
* 5xx: Server Error (The most commonly used error code is 500 __Internal Server Error__)


### 1.3 HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2

__HTTP__

HTTP -> TCP -> IP

__HTTPS__ (s - meaning secured)

HTTP -> __SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security)__ -> TCP -> IP


Summary it was interesting and useful indormation, but I think I will forget about 80% of this after a week.
